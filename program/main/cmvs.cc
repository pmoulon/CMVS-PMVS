  // Please refer to the paper for their definitions. The following are
  // brief explanations.
  //
  // CMVS tries to make sure that multi-view stereo (MVS)
  // reconstruction accuracy will be more than a certain threshold at
  // Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points. scoreRatioThreshold is this
  // threshold on the reconstruction accuracy [0, 1.0]. CMVS makes
  // sure that the ratio of "satisfied" SfM points is more than
  // coverageThreshold [0 1.0].
  //
  // Intuitively, increasing these parameters lead to more images and
  // clusters in the output.
