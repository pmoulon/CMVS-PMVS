* What is new in gsl-1.13:

** Upgraded to latest autoconf and automake (autoconf-2.64,
   automake-1.11)

** Fixed the rk4 and bspline allocators to avoid invalid free()
   calls under out of memory conditions. [bug #27194, #27236]

** Fixed a bug in gsl_multimin_fminimizer_nmsimplex2 where the center
   and size of the simplex were not updated on contract-by-best steps,
   causing failures in convergence. [bug #27180]

** Added new functions to set MISER and VEGAS Monte Carlo integration
   parameters, and to examine VEGAS chi-squared value and intermediate
   results.

** Added the function gsl_bspline_greville_abscissa to compute
   Greville abscissae for B-splines.

** The cumulative distribution functions gsl_cdf_gumbel1_{P,Q} should
   now handle a larger range of parameters without underflow and
   overflow.

** The header file gsl_const_cgs.h no longer defines values for
   electromagnetic units.  Applications should use gsl_const_cgsm.h
   instead to obtain the values in the CGS-Magnetic system.  The
   previous values for these units given in gsl_const_cgs.h were
   ill-defined as the type of CGS electromagnetic system was
   unspecified (the values were a mixture of CGS units with the Ampere
   of the MSKA system).  The affected constants are
   GSL_CONST_CGS_BOHR_MAGNETON, GSL_CONST_CGS_ELECTRON_CHARGE,
   GSL_CONST_CGS_ELECTRON_MAGNETIC_MOMENT, GSL_CONST_CGS_FARADAY,
   GSL_CONST_CGS_GAUSS, GSL_CONST_CGS_NUCLEAR_MAGNETON,
   GSL_CONST_CGS_PROTON_MAGNETIC_MOMENT, and GSL_CONST_CGS_ROENTGEN.

** The Pochhammer functions gsl_sf_poch(a,x) and gsl_sf_lnpoch(a,x) now
   handle the special cases where a and a+x are zero or negative
   integers.

** The confluent hypergeometric function gsl_sf_hyperg_U (a,b,x) now
   handles some cases where x=0. The case where 1+a-b is a negative
   integer no longer returns an error [bug #22859] and the incorrect
   termination of the series in certain cases is fixed [bug #26706].

** Added a new function gsl_poly_eval_derivs to evaluate a polynomial
   and its derivatives simultaneously.

** Added a new univariate minimisation algorithm
   gsl_min_fminimizer_quad_golden which is a variant of Brent's
   algorithm with safeguarded step-length adjustment.

** Added a new Nelder-Mead minimiser gsl_multimin_fminimizer_nmsimplex2rand
   which uses a randomly oriented simplex rather than one fixed on
   the coordinate axes [bug #25077]

** The texinfo file now uses the dircategory "Software libraries" from
   the Free Software Directory, as recommended in the Texinfo manual.

** The function gsl_ran_exponential now includes zero in its output
   range. [bug #25039]

** All functions for freeing allocated memory now accept a NULL
   pointer, following the standard C convention for free(). [bug
   #25319]

** The function gsl_sum_levin_u_accel now handles the special case
   c_0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + .... that occurs when summing power series
   c_n*x^n with x=0. [bug #26807]

** The functions gsl_linalg_LU_solve, gsl_linalg_LU_svx,
   gsl_linalg_LU_refine, gsl_linalg_LU_invert and their complex
   equivalents now return an error for singular matrices.

** The multifit LMDER hybrid solvers now check the return code of the
   user-supplied function in the gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_set
   method. [bug #26871]

** Improved the implementation of gsl_ran_discrete_preproc to avoid
   internal errors due to inconsistencies from excess precision on
   some platforms. [bug #26502]

** Corrected gsl_sf_hyperg_2F1(a,b,c,x) to not give a domain error in
   the case where c is a negative integer and the series terminates
   with a finite result.

** The C99 inline keyword is now supported, in addition to the
   previously supported GNU-style inline.

** Modified gsl_poly_complex_solve_cubic and gsl_poly_solve_cubic to
   avoid returning NaNs in cases where excess precision causes a
   change in the number of roots. 

** Fixed incorrect length check in gsl_blas_drotm. [bug #26503]

** Fixed gsl_odeiv_step_gear2 to restore y on step failure

** gsl_odeiv_evolve_apply now restores the correct value of t on step
   failures [bug #26255].

** Using make install prefix=DIR now puts correct paths in package
   config files gsl-config and gsl.pc

** Modified gsl_monte_vegas to work around pow() function inaccuracies
   on MinGW [bug #25413].

** Increased the number of terms in gsl_sf_mathieu_a and
   gsl_sf_mathieu_b to improve convergence in difficult regions [bug
   #25075]

* What was new in gsl-1.12:

** Upgraded to latest libtool, autoconf and automake (libtool-2.2.6,
   autoconf-2.63, automake-1.10.2)

** Improved the convergence of gsl_sf_gamma_inc_P for x/a ~=~ 1 and
   large x,a.  Fixes problems with large arguments in cdf functions
   such as gsl_cdf_chisq_Pinv(x,nu) [bug 24704].

** Fixed gsl_ran_gamma_knuth to handle the case of a >= UINT_MAX [bug
   #24897]

** Added gsl_bspline_eval_deriv to compute bspline derivatives
   (Rhys Ulerich)

** Added a faster simplex mininimser gsl_multimin_fminimizer_nmsimplex2
   which is O(N) instead of O(N^2) [bug #24418]

** Improved the original chi-squared formula in gsl_monte_vegas to
   avoid catastrophic cancellation [bug #24510].  The previous formula
   could return incorrect or negative values for relative errors <
   1e-8, which could occur when integrating very smooth functions.

** Added new auxiliary functions gsl_cheb_order, gsl_cheb_size,
   gsl_cheb_coeffs for Chebyshev series [bug #21830]

** Updated license of the reference manual to GNU FDL version 1.3.

** Fixed a bug where the gsl_isinf function would return +1 for -Inf
   on systems where isinf(-Inf) returns the non-standard value +1.
   [bug #24489]

** Added missing functions gsl_vector_complex_{isnonneg,add,sub,mul,
   div,scale,add_constant} and gsl_matrix_complex_float_isnonneg [bug
   #22478]

** Cross compilation should now work for x86 hosts.

** Fixed a bug in gsl_interp_accel_find() where values lying on the
   upper boundary between interpolation points could return the index
   from the lower side. [bug #24211]

** Fixed gsl_linalg_solve_cyc_tridiag so that its output respects the
   solution vector's stride. Previously the x_stride value was ignored
   causing the output to be incorrect for non-unit stride. [bug #24162]

** Corrected a bug in the series calculation of gsl_sf_ellint_Kcomp
   for k close to 1. [bug #24146]

** Extended gsl_linalg_QRPT_update to handle rectangular matrices.
   Corrected definition of the update formula in the manual for
   both gsl_linalg_QR_update and gsl_linalg_QRPT_update.

** Added routine gsl_linalg_cholesky_invert

** Fixed a bug the simplex algorithm which caused the second highest
   point to be incorrectly equal to the first when the first value was
   the highest, which could cause suboptimal convergence. [bug #23192]

** Fixed a problem with convergence for inverse gamma and chisq
   distribitions, gsl_cdf_gamma_{P,Q}inv and gsl_cdf_chisq_{P,Q}inv.
   [bug #23101]

** Improved the handling of constant regions in Vegas by eliminating
   spurious excess precision when computing box variances.

** Fixed a potential division by zero in gsl_monte_miser when the
   left/right weight factors decrease below 1.

** Fixed incorrect dimensions check in gsl_matrix_sub{row,column}

* What was new in gsl-1.11:

** The GSL repository and bug database are now hosted at Savannah
   http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gsl/

** Upgraded to latest libtool, autoconf and automake (libtool-2.2,
   autoconf-2.61, automake-1.10.1)

** Fixed underflow in ODE adaptive step size controller that could
   cause step size to decrease to zero (bug #21933).

** Improved the handling of the asymptotic regime in gsl_sf_bessel_jl.

** Improved the handling of large arguments in cumulative distribution
   functions using the incomplete beta function, such as gsl_cdf_fdist_P.

** Fixed overflow bug in gsl_cdf_hypergeometric_{P,Q} for large
   arguments (bug #22293).

** gsl_ran_gaussian_ziggurat now handles generators with different
   ranges explicitly, to minimise the number of function calls
   required (bug #21820).  Also fixes bug #22446 (rng limit in
   gsl_ran_chisq()).

** Added missing error terms in gsl_sf_exp_mult_e10_e to prevent
   the error being underestimated (bug #22041).  

** Updated some constants to the CODATA 2006 values.

** The hypergeometric function gsl_sf_hyperg_2F1 now handles the case
   where x==1.

** Fixed a bug in the brent minimiser which prevented optimal convergence.

** Added functions for evaluating complex polynomials

** The convergence condition for gsl_multiroots_test_delta now accepts
   dxi == 0.

** Improved functions gsl_ldexp and gsl_frexp to handle the full range
   of double precision numbers in all cases.

** Added new quasi random generators gsl_qrng_halton and
   gsl_qrng_reversehalton which support dimensions up to 1229.

** Added function gsl_multifit_linear_residuals for computing the
   residuals of the fit

* What was new in gsl-1.10:

** License updated to GNU GPL version 3.

** Added support for generalized eigensystems

** Added function gsl_stats_correlation to compute Pearson correlation
of two datasets

** Added the new function gsl_sf_expint(n,x) for computing the n-th
order exponential integral.

** Added functions gsl_vector_isnonneg and gsl_matrix_isnonneg.

** Added functions gsl_matrix_subrow and gsl_matrix_subcolumn

** Extended Cholesky routines to complex matrices

** Added support in gsl_ieee_set_mode for controlling SSE exceptions
and rounding through the MXCSR control word on x86 processors.

** The autoconf macro AM_PATH_GSL has been renamed to AX_PATH_GSL, to
avoid conflicts with the autoconf namespace.

** Improved handling of underflow in gsl_eigen_symm.

** The function gsl_multiroot_fdjacobian now returns the error code
GSL_ESING if any of the columns of the computed jacobian matrix are
zero.  This may occur if the step size of the derivative is too small.

** Extended the function gsl_sf_beta_inc(a,b,x) to handle cases where
a<0 or b<0.

** Fixed the round-off error estimate in gsl_deriv_{central,backwards,
forward} to correctly account for numerical error in the step-size h.

** Fixed gsl_cdf_beta_Pinv, gsl_cdf_gamma_Pinv, gsl_cdf_beta_Pinv to
avoid returning spurious values for large parameters when the
iteration did not converge.  If the iteration cannot converge, GSL_NAN
is returned.

** gsl_ran_dirichlet now handles smaller values of alpha[] without
underflow, avoiding a NaN in the returned value.

** The SVD routines now avoid underflow in the Schur decomposition for
matrices with extremely small values <O(1e-150).

** gsl_complex_pow now returns 0^0=1 (instead of zero) to match the usual
pow function, and handles z^(1,0) and z^(-1,0) as special cases.

** Fixed a bug in the set function for multifit lmder solver so that
previous values are cleared correctly.

** Improved the function gsl_log1p to prevent possible loss of
accuracy caused by optimisations.

** Improved the convergence test in the Lambert functions to take
account of finite precision and avoid possible failure to converge.

** The configure script no longer redefines finite() to isfinite() as
a workaround for missing finite(), as this caused problems on Solaris.
If finite() is not present gsl_finite() will be used instead.

** Improved the accuracy of the generalised laguerre polynomials for
large n when alpha=0.

** The functions gsl_{isnan,isinf,finite} will now always use the
system versions of isnan, isinf and finite if they are available.
Previously the portable GSL implementations were used whenever the
platform supported IEEE comparisons.  The portable gsl_isinf function
now returns -1 instead of +1 for -Inf, in line with recent versions of
the GNU C Library.

* What was new in gsl-1.9:

** Fixed the elliptic integrals F,E,P,D so that they have the correct
behavior for phi > pi/2 and phi < 0.  The angular argument is now
valid for all phi.  Also added the complete elliptic integral
gsl_sf_ellint_Pcomp.

** Added a new BFGS minimisation method gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_vector_bfgs2
based on the algorithm given by R.Fletcher in "Practical Methods of
Optimisation" (Second edition).  This requires substantially fewer
function and gradient evaluations, and supercedes the existing BFGS
minimiser.

** The beta functions gsl_sf_beta_e(a,b) and gsl_sf_lnbeta_e(a,b) now
handle negative arguments a,b.  Added new function gsl_sf_lnbeta_sgn_e
for computing magnitude and sign of negative beta values, analagous to
gsl_sf_lngamma_sgn_e.

** gsl_cheb_eval_mode now uses the same error estimate as
gsl_cheb_eval_err.

** Improved gsl_sf_legendre_sphPlm_e to avoid underflow with large
arguments.

** Added updated Knuth generator, gsl_rng_knuthran2002, from 9th
printing of "The Art of Computer Programming".  Fixes various
weaknesses in the earlier version gsl_rng_knuthran.  See
http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/news02.htm

** The functions gsl_multifit_fsolver_set, gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_set
and gsl_multiroot_fsolver_set, gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_set now have a
const qualifier for the input vector x, reflecting their actual usage.

** gsl_sf_expint_E2(x) now returns the correct value 1 for x==0,
instead of NaN.

** The gsl_ran_gamma function now uses the Marsaglia-Tsang fast gamma
method of gsl_ran_gamma_mt by default.

** The matrix and vector min/max functions now always propagate any
NaNs in their input.

** Prevented NaN occuring for extreme parameters in
gsl_cdf_fdist_{P,Q}inv and gsl_cdf_beta_{P,Q}inv

** Corrected error estimates for the angular reduction functions
gsl_sf_angle_restrict_symm_err and gsl_sf_angle_restrict_pos_err.
Fixed gsl_sf_angle_restrict_pos to avoid possibility of returning
small negative values.  Errors are now reported for out of range
negative arguments as well as positive.  These functions now return
NaN when there would be significant loss of precision.

** Corrected an error in the higher digits of M_PI_4 (this was beyond
the limit of double precision, so double precision results are not
affected).

** gsl_root_test_delta now always returns success if two iterates are
the same, x1==x0.

** A Japanese translation of the reference manual is now available
from the GSL webpage at http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ thanks to
Daisuke TOMINAGA.

** Added new functions for basis splines, see the "Basis Splines"
chapter in the GSL Reference Manual for details.

** Added new functions for testing the sign of vectors and matrices,
gsl_vector_ispos, gsl_vector_isneg, gsl_matrix_ispos and
gsl_matrix_isneg.

** Fixed a bug in gsl_sf_lnpoch_e and gsl_sf_lnpoch_sgn_e which caused
the incorrect value 1.0 instead of 0.0 to be returned for x==0.

** Fixed cancellation error in gsl_sf_laguerre_n for n > 1e7 so that
larger arguments can be calculated without loss of precision.

** Improved gsl_sf_zeta_e to return exactly zero for negative even
integers, avoiding less accurate trigonometric reduction.

** Fixed a bug in gsl_sf_zetam1_int_e where 0 was returned instead of
-1 for negative even integer arguments.

** When the differential equation solver gsl_odeiv_apply encounters a
singularity it returns the step-size which caused the error code from
the user-defined function, as opposed to leaving the step-size
unchanged.

** Added support for nonsymmetric eigensystems

** Added Mathieu functions

* What was new in gsl-1.8:

** Added an error check to trap multifit calls with fewer observations
than parameters.  Previously calling the multifit routines with n<p
would cause invalid memory access.

** Added the Debye unit to physical constants.

** Added cumulative distribution functions for the discrete
distributions, including binomial, poisson, geometric, negative
binomial, pascal and hypergeometric.

** Added the functions gsl_cdf_beta_{Pinv,Qinv} and
gsl_cdf_fdist_{Pinv,Qinv} for computing the inverse of the cumulative
beta and F distributions.

** Added the multilinear fit estimator function gsl_multifit_linear_est
for computing model values and their errors.

** Avoid division by zero in gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_vector_bfgs
if the step-size becomes too small.

** Users on DEC Alpha systems will need to specify their desired IEEE
arithmetic options via CFLAGS when building the library, as these are
no longer added automatically.

** Added new random variate generators gsl_ran_gaussian_ziggurat
and gsl_ran_gamma_mt for the Gaussian and Gamma distributions based on
the Marsaglia-Tsang ziggurat and fast gamma methods.

** Improved the speed of the exponential power distribution
gsl_ran_exppow.

** Improved the speed of the Gaussian ratio method by adding quadratic
bounds in gsl_ran_gaussian_ratio_method.

** Added an extra term to the taylor series of the synchrotron
functions gsl_sf_synchrotron_1 and gsl_sf_synchrotron_2 for small x to
ensure smooth matching with the chebyshev expansion.

** The binomial pdf gsl_ran_binomial_pdf now handles the cases p=0
and p=1 and is more accurate for the case of small p with k=0.

** Fixed the spherical bessel function gsl_sf_bessel_jl_e) to limit
the use of gsl_sf_bessel_Jnu_asympx_e to the range x>100*l*l to
satisfy he requirement x>>l*l in the asymptotic expansion.

** The scaled bessel function gsl_sf_bessel_In_scaled now handles
larger arguments x > 1e7 correctly for n < 150 using the uniform
asymptotic expansion instead of the continued fraction expansion.

** The functions gsl_stats_min/max now return NaN if the data contains
NaN. Similarly, the functions gsl_stats_min/max_index return the index
of the first occurring NaN in the data when it contains a NaN.

** Fixed an invalid memory access that caused incorrect results for
the special case in periodic cubic spline interpolation of 3 points.

** Added Debye functions for n=5 and n=6

** Added the missing functions gsl_spline_name() and
gsl_spline_min_size()

** The function gsl_rng_uniform_int(r,n) now returns an error for n=0,
which can occur when passing an unsigned integer value of 2^32.

* What was new in gsl-1.7:

** Switched gsl_randist_binomial to use the faster binomial random
variate TPE algorithm by default.  The previous binomial variate
algorithm is available as gsl_randist_binomial_knuth.  This will
result in a different sequence of binomial variates in programs using
this function.

** Improved the algorithm for gsl_sf_elljac_e to avoid cancellation
errors near quarter periods.

** Fixed the branch selection in gsl_sf_gamma_inc_Q_e to avoid
inaccurate results for large a,x where x~=~a.

** The multilinear fitting functions now have forms which accept a
user-specified tolerance for the SVD cutoff and return the
corresponding effective rank of the design matrix.

** The quadratic solvers in poly/ now handle linear equations
gracefully (i.e. quadratrics with a leading coefficient of zero).

** The output of "make check" now only shows test failures by default,
to reduce the amount of output.  Set the environment variable
GSL_TEST_VERBOSE=1 to display all the output.  To assist debugging,
the test number of each failure is shown in square brackets at the
line-end [NNNN].

** Fixed bugs in gsl_linalg_SV_decomp_jacobi which caused
incorrect results for some input matrices.

** Bessel, coulomb, dilogarithm and legendre_H3d functions now use
hypot internally to avoid overflow when computing terms like
sqrt(1+x*x).

** The 'Usage' chapter of the reference manual now explains how to
handle deprecated functions using the GSL_DISABLE_DEPRECATED macro.

** The conflicting enum definitions for 'forward' and 'backward' in
gsl_ftt.h and gsl_wavelet.h are deprecated.  User code should switch
to the new definitions gsl_fft_forward, gsl_fft_backward,
gsl_wavelet_forward and gsl_wavelet_backward. Selectively define
GSL_DISABLE_DEPRECATED before including the headers to use the new
definitions on either or both modules.

** Fixed an error in the the brent minimisation algorithm.  Iterations
should now follow Brent's original description correctly.

** The bound coulomb function gsl_sf_hydrogenicR_e no longer reports
an underflow for exact zeroes of the wavefunction.

** gsl_linalg_SV_decomp_jacobi now reports an error for the
unimplemented case M<N correctly.

** Fixed conformance test for the SYRK and HERK blas functions
gsl_blas_{s,d,c,z}syrk and gsl_blas_{c,z}herk for non-square matrices.

** Configure now checks for presence of ieeefp.h if needed.

** Differential equation solvers now propagate error codes returned
from user-defined functions to the top-level in all cases.

** Sort functions now avoid an infinite loop if Nans are present in
the input vector.  The order of nans in the output is undefined,
although other elements will be sorted correctly.

* What was new in gsl-1.6:

** Added a new wavelet directory, with 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional
discrete wavelet transforms.

** Added support for LQ and P^T LQ decompositions.  To find the QR
decomposition of large systems (M>>N) use the LQ decomposition,
solving the transpose of the original system.  This allows more
efficient memory access, and is useful for solving large least-squares
problems.

** Fixed a bug in the SYRK and HERK blas functions gsl_blas_{s,d,c,z}syrk 
and gsl_blas_{c,z}herk which caused invalid memory access for non-square 
matrices.

** Fixed a bug in gsl_swap_vectors which caused it to return incorrect
results when swapping vectors with different strides.

** Corrected the error estimate for gsl_cheb_eval_n_err to use
evaluation order instead of the approximation order.

** Improved the reliability of the gsl_sf_gamma_inc family of
functions.

** Equal abscissae are now handled gracefully in the cspline and
periodic cspline interpolations.

** Removed potential cancellation error in calculation of uniform
histogram ranges.

** Improved numerical stability of integration for akima and cspline
interpolation.

** Differential equation solvers now handle error codes returned from
user-defined functions.

** Improved error estimates in ode-initval solvers, and provide exact
derivatives on output.  Added new semi-implicit ode-initval solver,
gsl_odeiv_step_rk2simp.

** Added missing function definition for gsl_sf_psi_1.

** Fixed the function gsl_sf_expint_Ei_scaled to call
gsl_sf_expint_Ei_scaled_e instead of gsl_sf_expint_Ei_e.

** Added cumulative distribution function for exponential power
distribution.

** The functions gsl_cdf_beta_P and gsl_cdf_beta_Q now return
consistent results of 0 or 1 for out of range values, x<0 and x>1,
rather than 0 for left and right tails simultaneously.

** The Jacobi eigensolvers gsl_eigen_jacobi and gsl_eigen_jacobi_invert 
have new implementations from Golub and Van Loan.

** The standard output and standard error streams are now flushed by
the default error handler before the program aborts, in order to
ensure that error messages are properly displayed on some platforms.

* What was new in gsl-1.5:

** Multifit routines now handle iterations where |f| is already
minimised to zero, without division by zero.

** Fixed the singular value tolerance test in the multifit covariance
calculation from < to <= to match the original MINPACK code.

** The macro HAVE_INLINE is now tested with #ifdef instead of #if as
in versions prior to 1.4, to match the documentation, and the macro
GSL_RANGE_CHECK_OFF now works correctly.  An alternative macro
GSL_RANGE_CHECK={0,1} can be used to control range-checking.

** Fixed a potential array overflow in gsl_ran_landau.

** Fixed a small discrepancy in the tolerance calculation of the
one-dimensional brent minimiser.

** Numerical derivatives should now be calculated using the
gsl_deriv_forward, gsl_deriv_central and gsl_deriv_backward functions,
which accept a step-size argument in addition to the position x.  The
original gsl_diff functions (without the step-size) are deprecated.

** Corrected documentation for gsl_ran_hypergeometric_pdf()

** The tridiagonal matrix solvers gsl_linalg_solve_symm_tridiag,
gsl_linalg_solve_tridiag, gsl_linalg_solve_symm_cyc_tridiag,
gsl_linalg_solve_cyc_tridiag now use the GSL_ERROR macro to report
errors, instead of simply returning an error code.  The arguments to
these functions must now use exact lengths with no additional
elements.  For cyclic systems all vectors must be of length N, for
tridiagonal systems the offdiagonal elements must be of length N-1.

** The singular value decomposition routines gsl_linalg_SV_decomp and
gsl_linalg_SV_decomp_mod now handle the SVD of a column vector (N=1,
arbitrary M), which can occur in linear fitting.

** Restored missing header files gsl_const_mks.h and gsl_const_cgs.h.
The incorrect values of the electrical units for gsl_const_cgs
(VACUUM_PERMEABILITY and VACUUM_PERMITTIVITY) have been removed.

** Fixed gsl_linalg_SV_decomp() to avoid an infinite loop when
computing the SVD of matrices containing Inf and Nan.

** Fixed gsl_linalg_balance_columns() to avoid an infinite loop when
rescaling matrices containing Inf and NaN.

** Fixed header file <gsl/gsl_sf_log.h> to include declarations for 
error codes in inline versions of gsl_sf_log functions

** Fixed header file <gsl/gsl_const.h> to include new MKSA and CGSM
header files.

** Added Stefan-Boltzmann constant and Thomson cross section to
physical constants

* What was new in gsl-1.4:

** Added cumulative distribution functions and their inverses for the
continuous random distributions including: gaussian, lognormal, gamma,
beta, cauchy, laplace, chisq, exponential, gumbel, weibull,
F-distribution, t-distribution, logistic, pareto and rayleigh.

** Added faster binomial random variates using the TPE rejection
algorithm, in the function gsl_randist_binomial_tpe.

** Added new functions gsl_rng_fwrite and gsl_rnd_fread for storing
the state of random number generators in a file.

** Added a new function gsl_combination_memcpy()

** Corrected values of electrical constants in CGS units.  To take
account of different electrical systems of units the values are now
prefixed by GSL_CONST_MKSA (for the SI Metre, Kilogram, Second, Ampere
system) or GSL_CONST_CGSM (for the Centimetre, Gram, Second, Magnetic
system with the Gauss as the fundamental unit of magnetic field
strength).  The previous GSL_CONST_MKS and GSL_CONST_CGS prefixes have
been removed, as have the permeability and permittivity constants in
the CGS system since this uses different defining equations.

** Fixed bugs in the random number generators gsl_rng_fishman18,
gsl_rng_fishman2x, and gsl_rng_knuthran2 which caused them to return
incorrect results.  Minor corrections were made to the parameters in
the other Knuth generators borosh13, coveyou, fishman20, lecuyer21,
and waterman14.

** Fixed a missing transpose bug in the gsl_linalg_QR_QRsolve
and gsl_linalg_QRPT_QRsolve routines which were computing the
solution to Q^T R x = b instead of Q R x = b.

** Fixed gsl_sf_gammainv to return zero instead of a domain
error for arguments corresponding to singularities in gamma.

** Fixed a bug in the simplex minimization algorithm which
caused it to fail to find the second highest point correctly
when searching the set of simplex points.

** Fixed a bug in the conjugate gradient minimizers conjugate_pr,
conjugate_fr and vector_bgfs which caused the search
directions to be updated incorrectly.

** Fixed a bug in gsl_sf_psi_1_int(1) which caused it to
return the incorrect sign for psi(1,1).

** Fixed the simulated annealing routine gsl_siman_solve to use the

temperature instead of n_tries.

** Fixed a bug in gsl_combination_valid which caused it to return the
incorrect status.

** Fixed a bug in gsl_permutation_canonical_to_linear which caused the
output to always be zero, and the input permutation to be incorrectly
replaced by the output.

** Fixed a bug is gsl_ran_discrete which could cause uninitialised
data to be returned for some distributions.

** Fixed the dependencies for gsl_chebyshev.h to include gsl_math.h.

** Fixed a bug in gsl_complex_arccsc_real which caused it to return 
the incorrect sign for the imaginary part when -1<x<0.

in-place.

** IEEE modes now use the C99 fenv.h functions when platform spectific
functions are not available.

* What was new in gsl-1.3:

** Changed interface for gsl_sf_coupling_6j...(...). The old functions
actually calculated 6j for a permutation of the arguments (that
related to Racah W). This was incorrect and not consistent with
the documentation. The new versions calculate < {a,b,c}, {d,e,f} >,
as stated in the documentation. The old versions are still available
as gsl_sf_coupling_6j_INCORRECT...(...), though they are deprecated
and will be removed at some point in the future.

(scaled) form of the exponential integral, gsl_sf_expint_E1_scaled,
gsl_sf_expint_E2_scaled, gsl_sf_expint_Ei_scaled.

Multinomial distributions.

** Added a new function gsl_fcmp for approximate comparison of

has been improved to take account of numerical cancellation for small
arguments.

** Fixed memory leak in the Chebyshev module.

** The seeding procedure of mt19937 has been updated to the latest
version from Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura (Jan 2002). The
original seeding procedure is available through the generator
gsl_rng_mt19937_1999.

** A new random number generator gsl_rng_taus2 has been added to
correct flaws in the seeding procedure of gsl_rng_taus, as described
in an erratum to the original paper of P. L'Ecuyer.

** Added missing quasi-random number generator function gsl_qrng_init.

** Removed unnecessary endpoint subtraction in chebyshev-based
QUADPACK routines to avoid possible loss of precision.

** Fixed bug in gsl_interp_cspline_periodic which caused a
discontinuity in the derivative near the boundary.

** The function gsl_min_fminimizer_minimum has been renamed to
gsl_min_fminimizer_x_minimum for consistency (the old function name is
still available but is deprecated).  Additional functions have been
added for accessing the function values at the minimum and endpoints
of the bounding interval.

by a BUGS file, since we now require "make check" to work correctly
for stable releases.

configure stage and the functions gsl_isnan, gsl_isinf and gsl_finite
are only compiled on platforms which support the necessary tests.

gsl_histogram_sum for computing the total bin sum, and additional
statistics functions for 2d histograms.

** A bug in the multimin functions where the function parameters
(params) were omitted has been fixed.

could prevent the algorithms from converging.  Additional tests from
the NIST reference datasets have been added and these now agree with
MINPACK.

** All the physical constants and conversion factors are now defined as
real numbers to avoid potential problems with integer arithmetic.

** The ODE evolution routines now allow for negative step sizes, and
integrating backwards as well as forwards.

** The implicit Burlisch-Stoer ODE algorithm 'bsimp' now detects
singularities and forces a reduction in step size, preventing runaway
instabilities.

namespace conventions.

** Improved accuracy and fixed bugs in gsl_sf_hyperg_1F1,
gsl_sf_bessel_I0_scaled, gsl_sf_erfc, gsl_sf_log_erfc,
gsl_sf_legendre_Q0 and gsl_sf_legendre_Q1, and gsl_sf_zeta.

** Improved IEEE compliance of special functions, overflows now return
Inf and domain errors return NaN.

** Improved checking for underflows in special functions when using
extended precision registers

* What was new in gsl-0.9:

** There is a new system of vector and matrix views.  Any code using
vector and matrix views will need to be updated.  

** The order of arguments of the view functions involving strides have
been changed to be consistent with the rest of the library.

spaces in which the points cannot be represented as contiguous-memory
data structures.  gsl_siman_solve() now takes three extra arguments: a
copy constructor, a copy function and a destructor, allowing
gsl_siman_solve() to do its work with linked data structures.  If all
three of these function pointers are NULL, then the traditioanl
approach of using malloc(), memcpy(), and free() with the element size
is used.

instead of ";"

** The autogen.sh script, mostly for use by developers who use the CVS
repository, now does not run configure.

and comparing histograms, performing arithmetic on histograms and
finding maximum and minimum values. Corresponding functions have been
added for vectors and matrices.

** The linear algebra directory supports additional methods, including
rectangular QR, rectangular QRPT and Cholesky decomposition.

(sqrt, log, exp, sin, cos, tan, arcsin, arccos, arctan, sinh, cosh,
tanh, arcsinh, arccosh, arctanh) are now supported.

** Multidimensional minimization methods are now available.

** The special functions directory now includes a routine for
computing the value of the incomplete beta function.

** IEEE modes support on Sparclinux, Tru64, AIX and IRIX

** We have added the second generation RANLUX generators RANLXS and RANLXD

** Documentation now works out of the box with the standard Texinfo.

** Full reimplementation of the QUADPACK integration library

** Introduced THANKS file.
We appreciate all patches from people on the net, even those which are
too small to warrant adding the author to the AUTHORS file.  The
THANKS file should include everyone who sent in patches.  They should
also be mentioned in the ChangeLog entry.

* What was new in gsl-0.4.1:

** Two changes not making their way into the documentation
A couple of things are not getting into the docs, so here are the
errata:
*** The FFT routines now take a stride parameter.  Passing 1 for the
stride will make them behave as documented.
*** The complex numbers are now an opaque type, and no assumptions can
be made about the format in which they are stored (they are not stored
as a simple structure anymore, since that is not portable).  The type
is now gsl_complex (or gsl_complex_long_double or gsl_complex_float),
and the macros to access them are
    GSL_REAL(z)
    GSL_IMAG(z)
    GSL_COMPLEX_P_REAL(zp)
    GSL_COMPLEX_P_IMAG(zp)
    GSL_COMPLEX_EQ(z1,z2)
    GSL_SET_COMPLEX(zp,x,y)
    GSL_SET_REAL(zp,x)
    GSL_SET_IMAG(zp,y)

This change in the complex number API makes it important that you
start working with 0.4.1 or later.

** 0.4.1 is being released in occasion of the Red Hat 6.0 release.
The specfunc module is still in an alpha state; if you run "make
check" in the specfunc directory you will see that some tests still
fail.

** Most Alpha specific problems have been fixed. In particular the
random number generators rand48 and ranf now work on the Alpha

** Additional random number distributions: 
   Rayleigh distribution
   n-dimensional spherical distribution 
     (ie, points at random on an n-dimensional sphere)
   Gaussian tail distribution 
     (ie, choosing values from a gaussian distribution subject to a 
      constraint that they be larger than some fixed value, eg 5 sigmas)
   Walker's algorithm for arbitrary discrete distributions

* What was new in gsl-0.4:

** A single libgsl.a file is built in the top level directory and
installed, instead of separate .a files for each subdirectory.

** The parts of the complex struct gsl_complex, .real and .imag, are
not supported anymore. The macros GSL_REAL(z) and GSL_IMAG(z) do the
same job. All complex numbers are considered as packed arrays of
floating point numbers, for portability since the layout of structs or
arrays of structs is not guaranteed.

** The interface for matrices and vectors has changed. Vectors now
support strides, and can be used to access rows and columns of a
matrix. Many more types are available (float, double, long double,
int, long, short, char, signed and unsigned, plus complex floats,
doubles and long doubles) due to improvements in our preprocessor
template system.

** The random number generators have a completely new thread-safe
interface and have moved from the random directory to the rng
directory. Any program using random numbers will have to be
updated. You can also choose generators and seeds using the
environment variables GSL_RNG_TYPE and GSL_RNG_SEED.

** Some additional random number distributions have been added in the
randist directory. The available distributiosn are: bernoulli, beta,
binomial, cauchy, chisq, erlang, exponential, fdist, flat, gamma,
gauss, geometric, levy, logistic, lognormal, nbinomial, pareto,
poisson, sphere, tdist, twosidedexp, weibull.

** The FFT interface has be extended to support strides, but the
implementation hasn't been finished for all the cases yet, The FFT
allocation functions now return a pointer to a newly allocated
wavetable struct, instead of taking the pointer to an existing struct
as an argument.

   e.g. status = gsl_fft_wavetable_alloc(n, w)
   is now    w = gsl_fft_wavetable_alloc(n) in accordance with usual practice

** The statistics directory now works with all the builtin
types. It has a new function for computing the lag1-autocorrelation and
an extra set of numerical accuracy tests from NIST as part of 'make
check'.

** The simulated annealing routines no longer set the random number
seed with the time of day.  You'll need to reseed the generator
yourself if you want subsequent runs to use different random numbers.

** Work is in progress on a reimplementation of QUADPACK in the
`integration' subdirectory, but it is not finished yet.

** Work is in progress on reimplementations of the VEGAS and
MISER Monte Carlo algorithms in the monte' subdirectory.  They work
just fine, but the code is still evolving.

** Work has started on a portable blas system in the `blas'
subdirectory.

** You can now set the IEEE arithmetic mode for your programs from the
environment variable GSL_IEEE_MODE by calling the function
gsl_ieee_env_setup(). Currently this only works with the Linux kernel,
HP-UX, SunOS4 and Solaris.

** There are some simple spline interpolation functions in the `interp'
subdir.

** The NEWS file now uses outline mode, like the Emacs NEWS file


* This covers changes made *after* the gsl-0.2 snapshot

** Added several new modules: histogram, integration, matrix, specfunc
and vectors.

** Changed libgsl_statisctics.a to libgslstatistics.a and
libgsl_siman.a to libgslsiman.a, since most of the packages don't have
the underscore.  Users will have to remove the old files, unless they
do a "make uninstall" on the previous release before they install this
new one.

** Changes to the random number suite
Incorporated the gauss, poisson and exponential distributions in
the standard libgslrandom.a
