* add Erlang dist back in?

* DONE, for mu. 
  
  Note that we need to get rid of mu when it is not the mean.

  Yes, we should adopt the conventions from a standard reference book --
  the existing functions are drawn from a variety of sources, mostly
  Devroye's book on Random Variates (which is public domain, but not
  available electronically unfortunately).  Maybe the three volumes of
  Johnson & Kotz on Univariate Distributions would do, for
  example. Patches are welcome from anyone who wants sort this out.

* The exponential power distribution method could be speeded up by
using a rational function approximation for the rejection scaling
parameter.

* Do something about the possibility of the user providing invalid
parameters (e.g. negative variance etc). Not sure what to do though,
since returning an error code is not possible. Maybe just return zero.
  We should return NAN in this case, and for the CDFs.

* Add the triangular distribution.

* Look at Marsaglia & Tsang, "The Monte Python Method for generating
random variables", ACM TOMS Vol 24, No 3, p341 

and the paper on the Ziggurat Method: Journal of Statistical Software,
Volume 05 Issue 08. George Marsaglia and Wai Wan Tsang. "The ziggurat
method for generating random variables"
   
* Should 0 be included in distributions such as the exponential
distribution? If we want a consistent behaviour, is it included in
others?  Note that 1-gsl_rng_uniform() can have a slight loss of
precision when the random float is small.
