	also prototypes of new functions defined in discrete.c
	* test.c added tests for gsl_ran_discrete(), also
	* test.c made some essentially cosmetic changes:
	1/ redefined FUNC and FUNC2 macros so now output looks like 
	"test gsl_ran_poisson" instead of "gsl_ran_test_poisson"
	2/ changed names of toplevel tests, eg test_moments->testMoments, 
	test_pdf->testPDF, etc, to distinguish them from all the individual 
	functions test_poisson, test_binomial, etc.
	hope that's ok.
	* ../doc/random.texi updated to reflect the new discrete functions,
	as well as the new implementations of the sphere.c routines.

	gaussian random variables, normalized to the unit sphere
	also added ref's to Knuth and others describing the algorithms

 	gsl_ran_laplace

1998-07-26  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	is needed, and that is in the top level source directory.  This is

 	the uniform variate and the transformed number)

	* got rid of the 'bench-' programs. We will have a full testing
 	suite soon.

	* renamed the installed programs from 'dist' to 'gsl-dist' so that
 	they don't overwrite anything, e.g. it's possible the user might
 	have other programs called 'gauss' or 'gamma' installed in
 	/usr/local
