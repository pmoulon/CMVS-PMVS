This chapter describes routines for performing numerical integration
(quadrature) of a function in one dimension.  There are routines for
adaptive and non-adaptive integration of general functions, with
specialised routines for specific cases.  These include integration over
infinite and semi-infinite ranges, singular integrals, including
logarithmic singularities, computation of Cauchy principal values and
oscillatory integrals.  The library reimplements the algorithms used in
@sc{quadpack}, a numerical integration package written by Piessens,
Doncker-Kapenga, Uberhuber and Kahaner.  Fortran code for @sc{quadpack} is
available on Netlib.

The functions described in this chapter are declared in the header file
@file{gsl_integration.h}.

@node Numerical Integration Introduction
@section Introduction

Each algorithm computes an approximation to a definite integral of the
form,
@tex
\beforedisplay
$$
I = \int_a^b f(x) w(x) \,dx
$$
\afterdisplay
@end tex
@ifinfo

@example
I = \int_a^b f(x) w(x) dx
@end example

@end ifinfo
@noindent
where @math{w(x)} is a weight function (for general integrands @math{w(x)=1}).
The user provides absolute and relative error bounds 
@c{$(\hbox{\it epsabs}, \hbox{\it epsrel}\,)$}
@math{(epsabs, epsrel)} which specify the following accuracy requirement,
@tex
\beforedisplay
$$
|\hbox{\it RESULT} - I|  \leq \max(\hbox{\it epsabs}, \hbox{\it epsrel}\, |I|)
$$
\afterdisplay
@end tex
@ifinfo

@example
|RESULT - I|  <= max(epsabs, epsrel |I|)
@end example

@end ifinfo
@noindent
where 
@c{$\hbox{\it RESULT}$}
@math{RESULT} is the numerical approximation obtained by the
algorithm.  The algorithms attempt to estimate the absolute error
@c{$\hbox{\it ABSERR} = |\hbox{\it RESULT} - I|$}
@math{ABSERR = |RESULT - I|} in such a way that the following inequality
holds,
@tex
\beforedisplay
$$
|\hbox{\it RESULT} - I| \leq \hbox{\it ABSERR} \leq \max(\hbox{\it epsabs}, \hbox{\it epsrel}\,|I|)
$$
\afterdisplay
@end tex
@ifinfo

@example
|RESULT - I| <= ABSERR <= max(epsabs, epsrel |I|)
@end example

@end ifinfo
@noindent
In short, the routines return the first approximation 
which has an absolute error smaller than @c{$\hbox{\it epsabs}$}
@math{epsabs} or a relative error smaller than @c{$\hbox{\it epsrel}$}
@math{epsrel}.   

Note that this is an @i{either-or} constraint, 
not simultaneous.  To compute to a specified absolute error, set @c{$\hbox{\it epsrel}$}
@math{epsrel} to zero.  To compute to a specified relative error,
set @c{$\hbox{\it epsabs}$}
@math{epsabs} to zero.  
The routines will fail to converge if the error bounds are too
stringent, but always return the best approximation obtained up to
that stage.

The algorithms in @sc{quadpack} use a naming convention based on the
following letters,

@display 
@code{Q} - quadrature routine

@code{N} - non-adaptive integrator
@code{A} - adaptive integrator

@code{G} - general integrand (user-defined)
@code{W} - weight function with integrand

@code{S} - singularities can be more readily integrated
@code{P} - points of special difficulty can be supplied
@code{I} - infinite range of integration
@code{O} - oscillatory weight function, cos or sin
@code{F} - Fourier integral
@code{C} - Cauchy principal value
@end display

@noindent
The algorithms are built on pairs of quadrature rules, a higher order
rule and a lower order rule.  The higher order rule is used to compute
the best approximation to an integral over a small range.  The
difference between the results of the higher order rule and the lower
order rule gives an estimate of the error in the approximation.

@node Integrands without weight functions
@subsection Integrands without weight functions
@cindex Gauss-Kronrod quadrature
The algorithms for general functions (without a weight function) are
based on Gauss-Kronrod rules. 

A Gauss-Kronrod rule begins with a classical Gaussian quadrature rule of
order @math{m}.  This is extended with additional points between each of
the abscissae to give a higher order Kronrod rule of order @math{2m+1}.
The Kronrod rule is efficient because it reuses existing function
evaluations from the Gaussian rule.  

The higher order Kronrod rule is used as the best approximation to the
integral, and the difference between the two rules is used as an
estimate of the error in the approximation.

@node Integrands with weight functions
@subsection Integrands with weight functions
@cindex Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature
@cindex Modified Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature
For integrands with weight functions the algorithms use Clenshaw-Curtis
quadrature rules.  

A Clenshaw-Curtis rule begins with an @math{n}-th order Chebyshev
polynomial approximation to the integrand.  This polynomial can be
integrated exactly to give an approximation to the integral of the
original function.  The Chebyshev expansion can be extended to higher
orders to improve the approximation and provide an estimate of the
error.

@node Integrands with singular weight functions
@subsection Integrands with singular weight functions

The presence of singularities (or other behavior) in the integrand can
cause slow convergence in the Chebyshev approximation.  The modified
Clenshaw-Curtis rules used in @sc{quadpack} separate out several common
weight functions which cause slow convergence.  

These weight functions are integrated analytically against the Chebyshev
polynomials to precompute @dfn{modified Chebyshev moments}.  Combining
the moments with the Chebyshev approximation to the function gives the
desired integral.  The use of analytic integration for the singular part
of the function allows exact cancellations and substantially improves
the overall convergence behavior of the integration.


@node QNG non-adaptive Gauss-Kronrod integration
@section QNG non-adaptive Gauss-Kronrod integration
@cindex QNG quadrature algorithm

The QNG algorithm is a non-adaptive procedure which uses fixed
Gauss-Kronrod-Patterson abscissae to sample the integrand at a maximum of 87
points.  It is provided for fast integration of smooth functions.

@deftypefun int gsl_integration_qng (const gsl_function * @var{f}, double @var{a}, double @var{b}, double @var{epsabs}, double @var{epsrel}, double * @var{result}, double * @var{abserr}, size_t * @var{neval})

This function applies the Gauss-Kronrod 10-point, 21-point, 43-point and
87-point integration rules in succession until an estimate of the
integral of @math{f} over @math{(a,b)} is achieved within the desired
absolute and relative error limits, @var{epsabs} and @var{epsrel}.  The
function returns the final approximation, @var{result}, an estimate of
the absolute error, @var{abserr} and the number of function evaluations
used, @var{neval}.  The Gauss-Kronrod rules are designed in such a way
that each rule uses all the results of its predecessors, in order to
minimize the total number of function evaluations.
@end deftypefun


@node QAG adaptive integration
@section QAG adaptive integration
@cindex QAG quadrature algorithm

The QAG algorithm is a simple adaptive integration procedure.  The
integration region is divided into subintervals, and on each iteration
the subinterval with the largest estimated error is bisected.  This
reduces the overall error rapidly, as the subintervals become
concentrated around local difficulties in the integrand.  These
subintervals are managed by a @code{gsl_integration_workspace} struct,
which handles the memory for the subinterval ranges, results and error
estimates.

@deftypefun {gsl_integration_workspace *} gsl_integration_workspace_alloc (size_t @var{n}) 
@tpindex gsl_integration_workspace
This function allocates a workspace sufficient to hold @var{n} double
precision intervals, their integration results and error estimates.
@end deftypefun

@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int gsl_integration_qag (const gsl_function * @var{f}, double @var{a}, double @var{b}, double @var{epsabs}, double @var{epsrel}, size_t @var{limit}, int @var{key}, gsl_integration_workspace * @var{workspace},  double * @var{result}, double * @var{abserr})

This function applies an integration rule adaptively until an estimate
of the integral of @math{f} over @math{(a,b)} is achieved within the
desired absolute and relative error limits, @var{epsabs} and
@var{epsrel}.  The function returns the final approximation,
@var{result}, and an estimate of the absolute error, @var{abserr}.  The
integration rule is determined by the value of @var{key}, which should
be chosen from the following symbolic names,

@example
GSL_INTEG_GAUSS15  (key = 1)
GSL_INTEG_GAUSS21  (key = 2)
GSL_INTEG_GAUSS31  (key = 3)
GSL_INTEG_GAUSS41  (key = 4)
GSL_INTEG_GAUSS51  (key = 5)
GSL_INTEG_GAUSS61  (key = 6)
@end example

@noindent
corresponding to the 15, 21, 31, 41, 51 and 61 point Gauss-Kronrod
rules.  The higher-order rules give better accuracy for smooth functions,
while lower-order rules save time when the function contains local
difficulties, such as discontinuities.

On each iteration the adaptive integration strategy bisects the interval
with the largest error estimate.  The subintervals and their results are
stored in the memory provided by @var{workspace}.  The maximum number of
subintervals is given by @var{limit}, which may not exceed the allocated
size of the workspace.
@end deftypefun


@node QAGS adaptive integration with singularities
@section QAGS adaptive integration with singularities
@cindex QAGS quadrature algorithm

The presence of an integrable singularity in the integration region
causes an adaptive routine to concentrate new subintervals around the
singularity.  As the subintervals decrease in size the successive
approximations to the integral converge in a limiting fashion.  This
approach to the limit can be accelerated using an extrapolation
procedure.  The QAGS algorithm combines adaptive bisection with the Wynn
epsilon-algorithm to speed up the integration of many types of
integrable singularities.

@deftypefun int gsl_integration_qags (const gsl_function * @var{f}, double @var{a}, double @var{b}, double @var{epsabs}, double @var{epsrel}, size_t @var{limit}, gsl_integration_workspace * @var{workspace}, double * @var{result}, double * @var{abserr})

This function applies the Gauss-Kronrod 21-point integration rule
adaptively until an estimate of the integral of @math{f} over
@math{(a,b)} is achieved within the desired absolute and relative error
limits, @var{epsabs} and @var{epsrel}.  The results are extrapolated
using the epsilon-algorithm, which accelerates the convergence of the
integral in the presence of discontinuities and integrable
singularities.  The function returns the final approximation from the
extrapolation, @var{result}, and an estimate of the absolute error,
@var{abserr}.  The subintervals and their results are stored in the
memory provided by @var{workspace}.  The maximum number of subintervals
is given by @var{limit}, which may not exceed the allocated size of the
workspace.

This function applies the adaptive integration algorithm QAGS taking
account of the user-supplied locations of singular points.  The array
@var{pts} of length @var{npts} should contain the endpoints of the
integration ranges defined by the integration region and locations of
the singularities.  For example, to integrate over the region
@math{(a,b)} with break-points at @math{x_1, x_2, x_3} (where 
@math{a < x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < b}) the following @var{pts} array should be used

@example
pts[0] = a
pts[1] = x_1
pts[2] = x_2
pts[3] = x_3
pts[4] = b
@end example

@noindent
with @var{npts} = 5.

@noindent
If you know the locations of the singular points in the integration
region then this routine will be faster than @code{QAGS}.

This function computes the integral of the function @var{f} over the
infinite interval @math{(-\infty,+\infty)}.  The integral is mapped onto the
semi-open interval @math{(0,1]} using the transformation @math{x = (1-t)/t},

@noindent
It is then integrated using the QAGS algorithm.  The normal 21-point
Gauss-Kronrod rule of QAGS is replaced by a 15-point rule, because the
transformation can generate an integrable singularity at the origin.  In
this case a lower-order rule is more efficient.

subintervals is given by @var{limit}, which may not exceed the allocated
size of the workspace.

Those subintervals with ``large'' widths @math{d} where @math{d\omega > 4} are
computed using a 25-point Clenshaw-Curtis integration rule, which handles the
oscillatory behavior.  Subintervals with a ``small'' widths where
@math{d\omega < 4} are computed using a 15-point Gauss-Kronrod integration.

This function attempts to compute a Fourier integral of the function
@var{f} over the semi-infinite interval @math{[a,+\infty)}.
@tex
\beforedisplay
$$
\eqalign{
I & = \int_a^{+\infty} dx\, f(x) \left\{ \matrix{ \sin(\omega x) \cr
                                                 \cos(\omega x) } \right\}
}
$$
\afterdisplay
@end tex
@ifinfo

@example
I = \int_a^@{+\infty@} dx f(x) sin(omega x)
I = \int_a^@{+\infty@} dx f(x) cos(omega x)
@end example
@end ifinfo

The parameter @math{\omega} and choice of @math{\sin} or @math{\cos} is
taken from the table @var{wf} (the length @var{L} can take any value,
since it is overridden by this function to a value appropriate for the
fourier integration).  The integral is computed using the QAWO algorithm
over each of the subintervals,
@tex
\beforedisplay
$$
\eqalign{
C_1 & = [a, a + c] \cr
C_2 & = [a + c, a + 2c] \cr
\dots & = \dots \cr
C_k & = [a + (k-1) c, a + k c]
}
$$
\afterdisplay
@end tex
@ifinfo

@example
C_1 = [a, a + c]
C_2 = [a + c, a + 2 c]
... = ...
C_k = [a + (k-1) c, a + k c]
@end example

@end ifinfo
@noindent
where 
@c{$c = (2 \,\hbox{floor}(|\omega|) + 1) \pi/|\omega|$}
@math{c = (2 floor(|\omega|) + 1) \pi/|\omega|}.  The width @math{c} is
chosen to cover an odd number of periods so that the contributions from
the intervals alternate in sign and are monotonically decreasing when
@var{f} is positive and monotonically decreasing.  The sum of this
sequence of contributions is accelerated using the epsilon-algorithm.

This function works to an overall absolute tolerance of
@var{abserr}.  The following strategy is used: on each interval
@math{C_k} the algorithm tries to achieve the tolerance
@tex
\beforedisplay
$$
TOL_k = u_k \hbox{\it abserr}
$$
\afterdisplay
@end tex
@ifinfo

@example
TOL_k = u_k abserr
@end example

@end ifinfo
@noindent
where 
@c{$u_k = (1 - p)p^{k-1}$}
@math{u_k = (1 - p)p^@{k-1@}} and @math{p = 9/10}.  
The sum of the geometric series of contributions from each interval
gives an overall tolerance of @var{abserr}.

If the integration of a subinterval leads to difficulties then the
accuracy requirement for subsequent intervals is relaxed,
@tex
\beforedisplay
$$
TOL_k = u_k \max(\hbox{\it abserr}, \max_{i<k}\{E_i\})
$$
\afterdisplay
@end tex
@ifinfo

@example
TOL_k = u_k max(abserr, max_@{i<k@}@{E_i@})
@end example

@end ifinfo
@noindent
where @math{E_k} is the estimated error on the interval @math{C_k}.

The subintervals and their results are stored in the memory provided by
@var{workspace}.  The maximum number of subintervals is given by
@var{limit}, which may not exceed the allocated size of the workspace.
The integration over each subinterval uses the memory provided by
@var{cycle_workspace} as workspace for the QAWO algorithm.

@node Numerical integration error codes
@section Error codes

In addition to the standard error codes for invalid arguments the
functions can return the following values,

@table @code
@item GSL_EMAXITER
the maximum number of subdivisions was exceeded.
@item GSL_EROUND
cannot reach tolerance because of roundoff error,
or roundoff error was detected in the extrapolation table.
@item GSL_ESING  
a non-integrable singularity or other bad integrand behavior was found
in the integration interval.
@item GSL_EDIVERGE
the integral is divergent, or too slowly convergent to be integrated
numerically.
@end table

@node Numerical integration examples
@section Examples

The integrator @code{QAGS} will handle a large class of definite
integrals.  For example, consider the following integral, which has an
algebraic-logarithmic singularity at the origin,
@tex
\beforedisplay
$$
\int_0^1 x^{-1/2} \log(x) \,dx = -4
$$
\afterdisplay
@end tex
@ifinfo

@example
\int_0^1 x^@{-1/2@} log(x) dx = -4
@end example

@end ifinfo
@noindent
The program below computes this integral to a relative accuracy bound of
@code{1e-7}.

@example
@verbatiminclude examples/integration.c
@end example

@noindent
The results below show that the desired accuracy is achieved after 8
subdivisions. 

@example
$ ./a.out 
@verbatiminclude examples/integration.out
@end example

@noindent
In fact, the extrapolation procedure used by @code{QAGS} produces an
accuracy of almost twice as many digits.  The error estimate returned by
the extrapolation procedure is larger than the actual error, giving a
margin of safety of one order of magnitude.
