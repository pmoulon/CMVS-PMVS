2000-10-26  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@lanl.gov>

	* stamp-h.in: removed this file because it is auto-generated.

	* scripts/mkknownproblems.sh: fixed it so it's slightly better,

	double-precision even on extended precision architectures

2000-05-14  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* acconfig.h: 
	* configure.in: look in both <float.h> and /usr/include/float.h,
	to find FP_RND_RN, as some versions of GCC don't copy these
	symbols into the `fixed' header.

Thu May 11 12:47:19 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* gsl_math.h (GSL_POSZERO): added macros for IEEE signed zeros, +0

Wed May 10 11:30:15 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* gsl_math.h (GSL_POSINF): make use of HUGE_VAL which is actually

	script with Christopher Gabriel's, which is simpler.

	* autogen.sh: changed this into a no-brainer which does not invoke
	configure.

Mon Apr  3 15:43:25 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* applied patch from C M Murphy <C.M.Murphy@bath.ac.uk> to fix up

	* Changed matrix struct element dim2 to tda throughout

Mon Mar  6 19:48:27 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* gsl_version.h: added simple release-number based support for
 	accessing the version number at compile-time and run-time. This is
 	not a complete solution but it will do for now, as libtool
 	interface numbers are too complicated to worry about at the
 	moment due to other problems with libtool.

Thu Mar  2 20:52:50 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* templates_on.h (ATOMIC_IO): added an internal type for IO, for
 	the cases where it isn't possible to read and write a type
 	directly as text (e.g. char)

2000-02-23  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@lanl.gov>

	* Makefile.am, gsl.spec: added a gsl.spec.  Seems to work.

Sun Dec  5 14:20:43 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* added multidimensional minimisation directory, multimin/

1999-12-03  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@lanl.gov>

	* configure.in: upped the version to 0.5+, so that snaphots built
	out of CVS will not be confused with the 0.5 release.

	* AUTHORS, README, HACKING: changed my email address.

	* README: updated with some of Brian's suggestions.

	* configure.in, NEWS: fixed the new version to 0.5.

Tue Oct 19 11:15:16 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

1999-08-30  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@lanl.gov>

	* gsl-config.in: started adding this script, for now cannibalized
	from gnome-config.

	* configure.in: removed need to configure for rand() and RAND_MAX
 	by providing a simple random number generator in the directories
 	that used rand().

1999-08-05  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@lanl.gov>

	* Makefile.am: put the THANKS file into the distribution.

	* autogen.sh: added the --add-missing option to automake.  I'm
	surprised it was not already there.

	* configure.in: added a + to the version, indicating that any
	snapshots made from anonymous CVS in this state should be
	interpreted as "after 0.4.1 and before the next version", and no
	other promises.

	* THANKS: added this THANKS file.  We appreciate all patches from
	people on the net, even those which are too small to warrant
	adding the author to the AUTHORS file.  The THANKS file should
	include everyone who sent in patches.  They should also be
	mentioned in the ChangeLog entry.

Sat May  8 21:06:31 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* configure.in: now check for "extern inline" using a modified
 	version of AC_C_INLINE, since we use "extern inline" but only
 	checked for "inline", and some compilers only support the latter.

Sun Apr 11 20:40:35 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@netsci.freeserve.co.uk>

	* libraries and include files are now installed in pkglibdir and
	pkgincludedir (e.g. /usr/local/lib/gsl/ and
	/usr/local/include/gsl/ by default)

	* libraries are now built and installed separately

Mon Mar  1 15:41:25 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@netsci.freeserve.co.uk>

	* gsl_math.h: renamed gsl_fdf to gsl_function_fdf, so that it will
 	be more obvious what it is

Sun Feb 28 20:37:31 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@netsci.freeserve.co.uk>

	* gsl_mode.h: added prototype for GSL_MODE_PREC(mt)

Tue Feb 23 14:18:39 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@netsci.freeserve.co.uk>

	* gsl_math.h (GSL_FDF_EVAL_F): improved names of macros

Sat Feb 20 12:14:07 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@netsci.freeserve.co.uk>

	* split out polynomial root finding algorithms into a new poly/
 	directory

1999-02-25  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: upped the version to 0.4.1; this is ready for
	tagging.

1999-02-06  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* NEWS: udpated in occasion of the imminent 0.4.1 release.

Sun Feb 14 20:47:07 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@netsci.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Makefile.am: added gsl_mode.h to include_HEADERS

Mon Feb  8 18:39:35 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@netsci.freeserve.co.uk>

	* added new type gsl_function for arbitrary functions with
 	parameters, and gsl_fdf for functions and their derivatives

Mon Feb  8 18:39:35 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@netsci.freeserve.co.uk>

	* gsl_complex.h: added GSL_SET_REAL(&z,x) and GSL_SET_IMAG(&z,y),
 	changed GSL_COMPLEX_SET(z,x,y) to GSL_SET_COMPLEX(&z,x,y) to match.

1999-01-03  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.am, autogen.sh: improved autogen.sh, based on the gtk+
	autogen.sh.  Added it to Makefile.am's EXTRA_DIST list.

1999-01-02  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: introduced a test for hypot(), in case a system
	does not have it.

1999-01-03  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* autogen.sh: added this simple script which calls aclocal,
	automake --add-missind and autoconf, followed by ./configure with
	all the arguments.

	* configure, Makefile.in, */Makefile.in: removed these
	auto-generated files.

Fri Dec 11 16:50:27 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* AUTHORS: corrected the spelling of Gerard Jungman's name (it's
 	either Gerard or Jerry, but not Gerry)

1998-12-05  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: made the version be 0.4after so it's clear that
	snapshots will be post-0.4.

	* HACKING: updated a bit to work with the new CVS repository.

Mon Nov 23 16:09:21 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* gsl_config.h: removed, it was an unnecessary hack just for
 	defining macros. Autoconf's config.h should be used by the
 	programmer instead.
 
Sat Nov 21 20:39:14 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* texinfo.tex: removed, this is a duplicate and shouldn't be
 	needed in the top-level directory (it is in docs)

	* move any included headers in _source.c files into the master
 	file that includes the _source.c, since this saves time when
 	compiling

	* config.h.in: standardized on HAVE_PRINTF_LONGDOUBLE

Fri Nov 20 15:14:53 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* replaced DBL_EPSILON, DBL_MAX, ... by GSL_DBL_EPSILON,
 	GSL_DBL_MAX, ...

	* added sys directory for miscellaneous gsl system functions like
 	max and min

Thu Nov 19 22:46:43 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* config.h.in: removed MAX and MIN

Wed Nov 18 10:40:18 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* gsl_math.h: added prototypes for inline functions GSL_MAX_INT
 	etc

Tue Nov 10 20:05:27 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* gsl_math.h: moved the MAX(a,b) and MIN(a,b) to gsl_math.h and
 	renamed them GSL_MAX(a,b) and GSL_MIN(a,b) to avoid inevitable
 	conflicts with system macros.

Mon Nov  9 21:08:10 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* config.h: added MAX(a,b) and MIN(a,b) macros since we use these
 	everywhere. We assume that if they are defined by the system then
 	they do actually work.

1998-11-06    <bjg@ancho.lanl.gov>

	* configure.in: add -mieee on alpha platforms, also check for both
	scanf and printf working with long double

1998-08-31  James Theiler  <jt@lanl.gov>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): added utils directory

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): added utils/Makefile 

	* configure.in (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): added strtol, strtoul; removed
	strerror since it's already hardcoded into the err/ directory

1998-08-30  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: upped release number to 0.4; about to tag and make
	the release.

1998-08-20  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: upped version to 0.4-interim as we prepare for a
	0.4 snapshot.

	* NEWS: now refers to 0.4 instead of 0.3g.  Also "commented out"
	(smile) the note that says "we need to do a better job with the
	news file", since it looks quite good now!

1998-08-19  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* doc/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): added ran-exppow.tex,
	rand-levy.tex, rand-gumbel.tex and rand-bernoulli.tex to
	EXTRA_DIST.  Now they are included in the distribution and a "make
	distcheck" goes further.

Thu Jul 30 16:12:05 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* Makefile.am: now using a script to write the AR commands
 	explicitly, this should be more portable

Tue Jul 28 23:07:04 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* Makefile.am: new style single build of libgsl.a

Fri Jul 10 19:57:49 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* configure.in: removed AC_FUNC_ALLOCA since we don't use alloca
 	(it is not ansi)

Sun Jun 28 14:31:31 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* replaced the random/ directory by the rng/ directory and made
 	minor changes in randist/, siman/ to accommodate it

Tue Jun 23 19:49:22 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* added a top-level file gsl_config.h for detecting features when
 	users include the library headers. Currently it just turns on
 	HAVE_INLINE if you are using GCC or C++.

1998-05-16  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Brian fixed the error where libgslerr.a was not
	being installed in the 0.3e release, so I just bumped it up to
	0.3f to make a new release.

1998-05-14  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: upped the version to 0.3e, and this time I might
	actually make the public snapshot!

Wed Apr  8 18:30:48 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* Now using the automake variable check_PROGRAMS everywhere for
 	the testing programs (no need to build them unless we do make
 	check)

Mon Apr  6 15:09:08 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* added matrix and vector subdirectories

Wed Mar 18 10:27:27 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* gsl_complex.h: the typedef for 'complex' has been renamed to
 	gsl_complex, to avoid conflicts with C++ bindings and libstdc++

1998-02-09  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: 0.3b is now released, so I upped the version
	number to 0.3c-interim.

1998-02-09  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: upped version number to 0.3b

1998-01-30  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* AUTHORS: added Gerry Jungman to the authors list.
