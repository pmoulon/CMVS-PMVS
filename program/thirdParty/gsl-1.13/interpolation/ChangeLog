	correctly

Sun Dec  2 22:48:23 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

 	differences from Dan, Ho-Jin.

Tue Jul  3 12:10:53 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

Tue Jun 26 11:57:55 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* spline.c: added missing #include <string.h> for memcpy

Mon Jun 25 19:58:45 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* standardized to gsl conventions, added high-level 'spline'
 	interface

Mon Apr 30 13:29:34 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* renamed gsl_interp_obj to gsl_interp

Mon Apr 23 10:29:51 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* unified error handling conventions to _e for error handling
 	functions and no suffix for plain functions, so _impl functions
 	are no longer needed.

	* removed tests for EFAULT, since EFAULT should only apply to
 	invalid non-null pointers.


Tue Apr 11 19:56:25 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>
