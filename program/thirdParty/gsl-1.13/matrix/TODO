* Tests for subrowcol

* Pretty print function

* Clean up the tests.

* Run tests where matrix tda != size2, note that tda is a physical
dimension and size2 is the number of columns in the matrix. This will
probably find a lot of bugs in the matrix logic.

* Matrix norms that can be calculated analytically, e.g. Frobenius, etc
